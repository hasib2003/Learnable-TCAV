# Learnable CAV
Adding domain specific constraints to models using learnable able testing with concept activation vectors.

## EXP-1 
contains the main code of experiments
## EXP-2 
contains the cloned captum repository with tcav.py file changed for enabling gradient flow


To train the model on concept contraints, we use EXP-1/executors/train-with-concepts.
